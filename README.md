The SMS Spam Classifier project is a Python-based machine learning endeavor designed to identify spam messages. Leveraging natural language processing techniques, the classifier distinguishes between legitimate and spam texts. It involves preprocessing the text data, extracting relevant features, and training a classification modelâ€”typically utilizing algorithms like Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines. Upon completion, the classifier achieves high accuracy in detecting spam messages, making it a valuable tool for filtering unwanted communication.
